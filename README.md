# CSE 4940 2023 Fall Team 32
Basic outline to get you started with your repo.

## Issues Tab
Some issues representing tasks for this class.

## Actions Tab
You can set this up to automatically run tests whenever you commit. I have not played with this much, but it's probably a good idea to add some testing to your project.

## Projects Tab
Project management board and with issues added. You can view the Project in timeline-view or boards-view.

## Wiki Tab
Basic template for a wiki. Remember, your third "paper" will be your repository wiki.
